#Frogger#
A working version of Frogger playable in the browser, implemented with JavaScript.

All aspects of the assignment have been implemented correctly. Assignment was briefly discussed with Andrew Mendelsohn. Frogger took approximately 10 hours to complete.

All basic scoring methods are present, and the player recieves an additional life when 10,000 points are scored with fewer than 4 frogs left. Game loads immediately on page load. Frogger moves on canvas using UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT arrow keys. If frogger collides with a vehicle or water, he loses a life. 

Additionally: frogger is animated to dead_frog.png if he dies, the frogger theme is played in a loop during the game, and a leveling system is implemented that speeds up the cars after 5 frogs have been jumped home.
